/**
 * @ingroup IO
 * \brief Holds a vector of filenames relative to a given root directory.
 *
 * A FileList is a vector of filenames and thus determines a certain order
 * of the files that is now completely independent of the operating system and
 * filesystem. Other tools in our framework (e.g. compute_descriptors) rely on
 * this order and store the feature vectors of the corresponding images in exactly
 * the same order. This lets you determine the image filename from its feature id.
 *
 * This class has two main use cases:
 *
 * -# Listing all files with a given file-ending in and below rootdir.
 * Note: all subdirectories below root directory are parsed recursively.
 * -# Loading/saving/accessing//subsampling a previously generated list of filenames.
