  * use boost::any to pass in the data to be written. This works transparently for users as
  * most datatypes get automatically packaged into a boost:any. Thus, users can still
  * simply call push_back() passing e.g. a vector<float>.

/**
 * @brief Writes a binary vector-like file ('property file') to harddisk that contains elements of type T
 *
 * In our usage-scenario, T usually is a descriptor that encodes an image/sketch. A typical example is
 * T = std::vector<float> in the case of a global descriptor. In a bag-of-features approach, typically
 * T = vector<vector<float> >, i.e. all local features of a single image. PropertyWriterT supports all
 * element types T that are implemented in imdb::io as well as arbitrary nestings of those.
 *
 * PropertyWriterT supports huge files without any performance loss, typically limited only by your
 * free harddisk space. We have sucessfully generated files close to a Terabyte in size. The files are
 * directly portable between 64-bit and 32-bit machines but not portable between machines of differing endianness.
 *
 * Use PropertyReaderT to read in a property file that has been written with PropertyWriterT.
 *
 * Note: instances are noncopyable since they internally open files.
